      <description>Executive SummaryThe given data set allowed us to explore the Airbnb in Singapore and its special characteristics in detail. In order to derive meaningful statements in a comprehensive way we performed various operations in the beginning. These measures included the elimination of columns not related to our desired outcome, transformation of columns into workable data, elimination of extreme outliers as well as the creation of new columns.</description>

      <description>US Treasury Yield Curve AnalysisPrior to 2020, the last 7 macroeconomic recessions were preceeded by an inversion of the US government yield curve. We are going to investigate this.
First, we use the tidyquant package to download monthly rates for different durations.
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MStickers &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;TB3MS&amp;#39;, # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)&amp;#39;TB6MS&amp;#39;, # 6-month&amp;#39;GS1&amp;#39;, # 1-year&amp;#39;GS2&amp;#39;, # 2-year, etc.</description>

      <description>Omega Group plc- Pay DiscriminationScenario: A sample of 50 employees (24 men, 26 women) at Omega Group Plc showed a 8,700 difference in average salary for men compared to women.
We are going to investigate whether this marked difference is indeed significant and whether there is an observable factor (such as experience) that could explain the difference.
